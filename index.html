				<p class="paragraf">Text is the building block of the words people read in blogs, stories, and all other types of written content. However,the text visible on internet and digital platforms is not that simple in its origin. In fact, it undergoes intensive editing before final publication, and the editing is not simple either. It is technical in nature, but the good thing is that there are text editors to get things done. They are used by programmers, developers, and content creators, helping them provide a proper format to the written content. So here are the top five text editors for Windows that do an excellent job of modifying the text files.</p>

				<p><strong>1.</strong> <span class="note-"><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></span></p>

				<span>A free source code editor for Windows, Notepad++ was developed by Don Ho in 2003, and even after 15 years, it continues to be the most credible text editor for developers and programmers. It has been rated as the "most popular text editor" and "most used text editor" by Lifehacker and Stack Overflow, respectively. It is simple and lightweight and thus a great editing tool for all those who want to keep things clutter-free and yet create commendable work. To edit the file, all one has to do is right-click the file and choose Edit with Notepad++ from the context menu.</span></p>
				<p>The editor features syntax highlighting, code folding, and limited auto-completion for programming, scripting, and markup languages. A replacement for Notepad, it supports several programming languages and is based on Scintilla â€” the powerful editor component. It uses pure Win32 API and STL, which translates into faster execution speed and smaller program size, something programmers always look forward to in a text editor. Besides being user friendly and lightweight, it also offers several advantages to the user.</p>
				<p>It automatically restores recently opened and unsaved files, which means one can edit without any worry because if one forgets to save, it will be done by Notepad++ every time, without fail. It also auto-completes words as one edits, saving time and effort as a result. The best part is the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), which means the edited text will appear the same in the editor as it will when printed or published.</p>
				<p>Notepad++ is quite flexible and supports macros and multiple plugins, courtesy of the strong plugin architecture. As of now, more than 140 compatible plugins are available for the Windows text editor, including the 10, which are included by default in the program. The editor is widely used and has a huge user base spread in different parts of the world because it supports 84 languages. It offers internationalization through XML files in an application specific format, which contains all internationalized strings in a specific language. This file can be reloaded from application settings, and one can translate the text to new languages by just editing an existing file. It can save text documents in a huge variety of formats such as TXT, CSS, ASM, AU3, BASH, BAT, HPP, CC, DIFF, HTML, REG, HEX, JAVA, SQL, VBS, and more.</p>
				<p>Notepad++ has kept pace with the evolving technical developments as well as the changing environment. The latest version 7.6.4 was launched only this month, and the developers are constantly trying to optimize as many routines as possible to reduce carbon footprints. Suited for beginners as well as pros, Notepad++ is really the best text editor for Windows environment that brings best results in editing.</p>

				<p>The simultaneous editing allows execution of the same change at multiple places. The syntax highlighting and high-contrast display lower the eyestrain, while auto-complete completes entries as the user types, which speeds up editing.</p>

Sublime Text provides 23 different visual themes and a number of screen modes where one can view maximum of four files or select the full screen mode as one wishes.
